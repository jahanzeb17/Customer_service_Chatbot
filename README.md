# 🤖 Agentic AI Customer Support System using LangGraph & Groq (LLaMA3)

This project implements an **Agentic AI-driven Customer Support Workflow** that autonomously handles incoming customer queries using LangGraph, powered by Groq’s ultra-fast inference of `LLaMA3-8B`.

It classifies queries, analyzes sentiment, and dynamically routes them to the appropriate support agent — Technical, Billing, or General — or escalates to a human agent if needed.
